Welcome to our Ansible project on the commercial side!

Our organization is focused on using Ansible to create and test projects in a local environment. By bringing together a diverse group of collaborators, we aim to learn from each other and make the most of our shared passion for automation.

This project on GitHub is dedicated to developing and improving our ansible skills outside of work, while keeping our production network playbooks separate in our Army github.

We believe that by working together and sharing our knowledge and resources, we can make a real impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of our projects. Whether you are an experienced developer or new to ansible, we welcome your contribution and participation.

Together, let's build and test innovative projects using ansible. We look forward to collaborating with you!
