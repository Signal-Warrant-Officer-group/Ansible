Welcome to our Ansible project on the commercial side!

Our organization is focused on using Ansible to create and test projects in a local environment. By bringing together a diverse group of collaborators, we aim to learn from each other and make the most of our shared passion for automation.

This project on GitHub is dedicated to developing and improving our ansible skills outside of work, while keeping our production network playbooks separate in our Army github.

We believe that by working together and sharing our knowledge and resources, we can make a real impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of our projects. Whether you are an experienced developer or new to ansible, we welcome your contribution and participation.

Together, let's build and test innovative projects using ansible. We look forward to collaborating with you!

--- update December 22 2022 ---

I wanted to bring to your attention that due to the new policy, we are no longer able to push code up for testing in an environment. This means that the usual process of using VS Code to test and push playbooks will not be possible.  Otherwise we would need to pay for the team plan which is $4 per user.

The only option available to us at this time is to create playbooks locally, test them, and then manually upload them into the repository. This may require a bit more time and effort on our part, but it is important that we follow the new policy in order to maintain the integrity and security of our systems.

19 DEC 2022 Update: 

When creating playbooks for specifc devices (Cisco, Palo Alto, ESXI, ect) place the YAML file in the respective file 

example

/playbook/cisco_ios/<name>.yaml
